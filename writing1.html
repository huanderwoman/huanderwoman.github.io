          <h1>The Cost of My Skyline: A Reflection on Shanghai</h1>

          <p>Answering where I call home is always tricky. As I say “Shanghai,” rhyming it with an American vernacular to “Slang-high,” I grimace and anticipate the shock. </p>
          <p>“Wow, your English is really amazing,” is usually the first response.</p>
          <p>Following a series of “Wow, were you adopted?” or “Did you come here when you were really young?” I finish the song and dance of explaining that I am an American citizen, that my parents are actually from Taiwan and not Mainland China, that I went to an International School (hence my lack of a Chinese accent) and that I have to apply for a visa every time I go home to see my dog.</p>
          <p>On numerous occasions, this waltz of cultural confusion is disrupted with those who have spent a year abroad in Shanghai in the International Program. “Don’t you mean Shong-hai?” they would say, adding the emphasis on “Shong,” as if this accented pronunciation warrants a gentle correction to bring me back to my “Oriental roots.” Building off this immediate and apparently primordial connection, they proceed to tell me that they enjoyed M1nt, the snazzy nightclub with a shark tank or midnight skewer runs with the cost of two dollars. “Shanghai is wonderful,” they would say. “The American dollar takes you pretty far,” they would rejoice. “It was living the ‘high’ life.”</p>
          <h3>Democracy is Not a Will of the West</h3>
          <p>I cannot help but to feel a biting uneasiness. “A year in a well-protected bubble that is International Programs does not make you ‘from Shanghai,’” I would think. You can change your “lives in” location on Facebook to Shanghai and your profile picture to you with the Oriental Pearl Tower, but the Shanghai you experience is filtered with glitz, Pepperdine’s (rightful) coddling policies to prevent lawsuits, the relative freedom to drink liberally and quite frankly, a time constraint that prevents you from seeing the complexity that is Shanghai.</p>

        <div class="page col-11 col-lg-5" id='about-summary'>
          <p> My name in Mandarin is “Huang Jia En,” which means "additional blessing," and my brother is nine years my senior.  Go figure.  I suppose “Whoopsie Huang” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it. </p>
          <p> A more common term ascribed to me in this day and age is the term “extra,” partially in part to my boundless obsession with wordplay and narratives.  </p>
          <p> To explain, I am a byproduct of my Taiwanese heritage, Shanghainese upbringing, and American education.   Call it cultural homelessness or a "well rounded" global perspective, but regardless of which corner of the globe I inhabit, I have never been truly at home.  </p>
          <p> This restlessness results in a genuine love of people and growing interest in storytelling, - whether it be the displaced refugee, rising YouTube star, trends in cosmetic surgery.  I’ll throw my pen (or rather, keyboard, at it).</p>
          <p> At the end of the day, I’m happy to see you here.  Feel free to say hello at helloimjustina@gmail.com!</p>
