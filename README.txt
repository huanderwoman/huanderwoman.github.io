UPDATE YOUR RESUME

To add a new item to your resume first start by navigating to the file named "resume.html" in the huanderwoman github repository. After opening resume.html click on the pencil in the toolbar to edit the file. Scroll down to line 116 of the code that reads <div class="resume-content">. Directly below this line paste in your new resume item with the following formatting:

<h6>Place of work, Job title</h6>

<p>Job description</p>

Indentation does not matter.
